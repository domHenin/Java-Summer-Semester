// All the factoids about beer and exercise given in this assignment are paraphrased from realbeer.com.
// ..
// Problem A:  Cost of Beer
// Studies have shown that, on average, someone who consumes a single 12-ounce can of beer every day without
// compensating for the calorie intake through diet modifications or extra exercise, will gain approximately 15 pounds
// in one year. You can assume this ratio of beer-to-weight-gain is constant. (For example, doubling the beer
// consumption to two 12-ounce cans per day will lead to 30 pounds of extra weight in one year.)
// ..
// You will have to ask the user how many beers he or she expects to consume each day, on average, as well as the
// average amount of money he or she spends on a single 12-ounce can of beer. Using this information, your goal is to
// write a program to determine the following:
// ..
// How many beers will the user consume over the course of the year?
// Assuming a beer is 150 calories, how many calories will the user take in from beer alone over the course of the year?
// How much weight can the user expect to gain in one year based on the number of 12-ounce beers they consume every day?
// How much the user will spend on beer this year?
// ..
// All output should be displayed using 2 digits of precision after the decimal point!
// ..
// You may assume that there are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years).
// ..
// Input Specification
// The number of 12-ounce beers consumed each day will be a non-negative real number.
// How much the user spends on a single beer, on average, will be a positive real number. (Some people like cheap beer,
// while others pay a bit more for their favorite brand.)
// ..
// Output Sample
// ..
// Here is one sample output of running the program. Note that this test is NOT a comprehensive test. You should test
// your program with different data than is shown here based on the specifications given. The user input is given in
// italicswhile the program output is in bold.
// ..
// Sample Run #1
// On average, how many beers will you consume each day?
// 2.5
// On average, how much will you pay for each can of beer?
// 1.25
// That is approximately 912.50 beers in one year.
// ..
// In one year, you will consume approximately 136875.00 calories from beer alone.
// ..
// Without diet or exercise to counter these calories, you can expect to gain 37.50 pounds from drinking that much beer this year.
// ..
// Submission Requirements:
// Create your design tool in a separate file that you add to your Java project.
// Compress all files from this project including the design tool.
// Submit your compressed project.
// Be sure to specify in your submission comments whether you did you work in Mac or Windows.
