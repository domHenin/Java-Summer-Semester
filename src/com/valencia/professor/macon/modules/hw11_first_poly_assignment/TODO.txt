      All sport type objects have a method named doThis();

 ..
      FootballPlayer -> doThis() displays I tackle something.
 ..
      HockeyPlayer -> doThis() displays I sit in a penalty box.
 ..
      Golfer -> doThis() displays I putt it in the hole.

      SoccerPlayer -> doThis() displays I kick the ball
 ..
      ... in general, all sports have a doThis() method that displays something.
 ..
      Main()
      Create the classes Person, Athlete, BaseballPlayer
      Create the classes FootballPlayer, HockeyPlayer, Golfer, SoccerPlayer
      Create the doThis() method in each class
 ..
 In main create the follow reference variables:
      BaseballPlayer Hank (create this reference variable)
      FootballPlayer Terry (create this reference variable)
      HockeyPlayer Mario (create this reference variable)
      Golfer Paula (create this reference variable)
      SoccerPlayer Danilo (create this reference variable)
      BaseballPlayer Barry (create this reference variable)
      FootballPlayer Peyton (create this reference variable)
      HockeyPlayer Wayne (create this reference variable)

      And then...
 ..
      Call each sport's doThis method (one at a time) passing each player.
      Call the toString methods for each player object.
      You are to turn in a UML, and CODE.
