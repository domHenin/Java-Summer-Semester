// TODO:
// Program Specifications:
// Start by watching Video Segment 16 from Dr. Colin Archibald's video series (found in the module overview(.  Key in the program shown in the video and make sure it works.
//        Then, add the following:
//
//
//        Animals have a Weight.
//        Animals have a Height.
//        Dog is an Animal.
//        Dogs have a Name.
//        Dogs have a Breed.
//        Dogs have a DOB.
//        Cat is an Animal
//        Cats have a Name.
//        Cats have 9 lives, so you need to keep track of the remaining lives once a cat dies.
//        Bird is an Animal
//        Birds have a wing span
//        Birds have a canFly which is true or false (some birds cannot fly)
//        Create a test class that creates one of each type of animal and displays the animalâ€™s toString method.
